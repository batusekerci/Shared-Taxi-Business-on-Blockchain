# Shared-Taxi-Business-on-Blockchain

This a smart contract that handles a common asset and distribution of income generated from this asset in certain time intervals. The common asset in this scenario is a taxi.
A group of people in the same neighborhood would like to invest into an asset. They cannot invest individually because each person has a very small amount of money, thus they can combine their holdings together to invest into a bigger and more profitable investment. They decided to combine their money and buy a car which will be used as a taxi and the profit will be shared among participants every month. However, they have no trust in each other. To make this investment work, this smart contract will handle the transactions. The contract will run on Ethereum network.
